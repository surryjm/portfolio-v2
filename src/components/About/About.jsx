          <p className="subtitle">Front-End Developer, Previous Customer Success Manager</p>
          <p className="long-description">I have 10 years of experience providing high-touch customer support for clients, 
            anticipating their needs, prioritizing issues, and communicating between teams â€“ a blend of empathy, 
            customer advocacy and creative problem solving.</p>
          <p className="long-description">I've always had an interest in front-end development and started down the 
            coding rabbit hole in 2019, with freeCodeCamp. From there I completed the Certificate in Front-End 
            Development with HTML, CSS & JavaScript and then the Certificate in Full-Stack Development with JavaScript, 
            both through the University of Washington Professional & Continuing Education program. I've been the 
            instructional assistant for the Full-Stack program since January 2022.</p>
          <p className="long-description">I'm excited to bring my customer background to a developer role and thrive 
            in an environment that prioritizes learning, teamwork and diversity.</p>
